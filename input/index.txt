Welcome to HK climate
=====================

In this text, we maintain that there is no reason whatsoever to worry
about anthropogenic (human-induced) climate change, because there is
no evidence whatsoever that such a thing is happening. We explain that
it is all misinformation, and we invite you to check the evidence and
reasoning that we provide to you.

Why do people think that there is anthropogenic climate change? The
alleged evidence which we've seen so far includes the following
arguments:

* The ice near the poles has been melting.
* Extreme weather phenomena have been increasing in frequency.
* You remember that the weather was different in your childhood.
* The average temperature of the earth has been increasing.
* The computer models predict a further temperature rise in the
  future.
* Scientists agree that there is anthropogenic climate change.
* In the absence of conclusive evidence, action should be taken
  pre-emptively.
* We are in the pay of big oil.

In the following pages, we examine these arguments one by one. We show
that some are entirely false; and that some may be correct but they do
not constitute any evidence of anthropogenic climate change.
