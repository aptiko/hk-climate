Epilogue: Chaos, Hurst-Kolmogorov behaviour, and uncertainty
============================================================

Have you ever wondered how weather predictions are made? If you think
that it's meteorologists looking at satellite pictures or weather maps
and determining how current weather will move, you got it wrong.
Weather predictions are made with weather models (these are similar to
climate models, but they work at different scales and have some other
differences). Let's see how it works.

Every 12 hours, meteorological centres around the world send
meteorological balloons up. These are little balloons with several
meteorological sensors attached, such as a thermometer and a pressure
sensor, and a trasmitter that transmits the measurements to a ground
station. As the balloon goes up in the atmosphere, the measurements
are transmitted to the ground, and so the meteorological variables at
many altitudes are recorded. These measurements from around the world
are collected, together with measurements from ships and aeroplanes,
and they tell us how the weather was at the time the measurements were
made. In order to make the calculations needed for the prediction, the
atmosphere is divided into little pieces in such a way that the
temperature, pressure, etc., in each little piece is known by the
measurements.  Because we know the natural laws that describe how
conditions in each piece are affected by its neighbouring pieces, we
can calculate how each piece will evolve in time, and hence we have a
prediction of the weather.  The number of calculations required is
huge and can only be performed by a computer. In other words, a
computer simulates the atmosphere. The system of simulation (which is
effectively a set of equations) is called a weather model. The input
to the weather model (i.e. the measurements of the current weather) is
called the initial conditions.

This way of weather forecasting was first used in the 1960s.  Edward
Lorenz, one of the first scientists to experiment with a weather
model, tried to make a forecast for two months ahead, and for some
reason he performed the calculation twice.  Although in both
calculations he used the same weather model and the same initial
conditions, the results were completely different. At first he thought
he had made an error, and after investigation he found that one of the
times he had run the simulation he had rounded the initial conditions
to the third decimal digit; the other time he had rounded to the sixth
decimal digit [#cooper]_.  This means that even if you could
accurately determine the initial conditions in every place of the
earth (and the atmosphere), you'd still be unable to predict the
weather in two months: because an input temperature of 31.23856 and an
input temperature of 31.23857 would give completely different results.
The mathematical term for this is **chaos**; we say that a function is
chaotic if infinitesimal differences in the input cause huge
differences in the output. The reason weather models have such
unstable behaviour when you try to forecast the weather two months
ahead is that the weather is chaotic.

Another way to explain this is the well-known example with the
hurricane and the butterfly. If you tried to forecast if a hurricane
in America will form a week from now, and you knew exactly the laws of
motion that describe the creation of the hurricane, and you knew the
initial conditions (the present conditions) in every point of the
atmosphere, you'd still be unable to forecast; because even a
butterfly moving its wings in China would alter conditions enough in
order to yield a different result. This does not mean that the
butterfly is the cause of the hurricane; rather, it means that the
creation of the hurricane is so sensitive to the infinitesimal
difference that could be present in its "causes" that causality
effectively disappears altogether and the hurricane is reduced to a
random phenomenon.

It is easier to understand it if instead of trying to predict a
hurricane we try to predict the outcome of a roulette. Suppose you
know everything you need in order to calculate the outcome of the
roulette: the initial velocity of the ball, the initial angle speed of
the wheel, the weight, elasticity, and other properties of the ball,
the properties of the roulette, the properties of the wheel, the
temperature of the ball, roulette, and wheel, the air temperature and
pressure, humidity, and so on. Would you be able to predict the
outcome? The answer is no, because this, too, is chaotic, provided you
spin the roulette reasonably fast and provided you give the ball a
reasonable initial speed. A mere random collision of a molecule of air
would make a difference large enough in order to change the outcome.
This does not mean that the collision is the reason for the outcome;
the outcome depends on everything and nothing at the same time, so
that it is effectively random.

The roulette is an artificially created system with only 37 possible
outcomes, each one with an equal probability. Natural systems are much
more complicated than that. The atmosphere is incredibly more
complicated, and while weather models can predict the weather for
three, sometimes maybe four or five, days ahead, they can't do better,
and no matter how much you improve the models or the knowledge of the
initial conditions, you'll never be able to forecast more than two
weeks ahead, simply because you don't know what all butterflies of the
world are doing or will do, let alone all molecules of air in the
atmosphere.

There are, however, important things that you know about the roulette.
Although its results are random, you know that the average
value is 18, and that the value ranges in a uniform manner from 0 to
36. You can think of roulette outcomes as random variations around a
mean of 18, as Figure 1 shows. But the roulette is an extremely simple
artificial system. Natural systems are much more complicated than
that.

People have been tempted to think of climate in much the same way as a
roulette, and that is the dominating view in climate
science. It is alleged that the "climate", or "signal", is something like
the average value of the roulette, with the "weather", or "noise",
being something like the specific roulette outcome. It is alleged that
the average temperature of the Earth is, say, 15°C, but the
temperature in Athens in 13 April 2009 can be 22°C, in much the same
way that the average roulette outcome is 18 but a specific roulette
outcome can be 31. If you average many successive roulette outcomes,
the result will be 18; and it is claimed that, similarly, if you
average the temperature of all locations of the Earth for many
successive years, the result will be, say, 15°C. The roulette outcome
varies, but the underlying average remains the same.  If the average
of the roulette changes, this will be traced to a specific reason,
such as a modification of the wheel; and it is assumed that a change
in the "underlying climate" will always have a specific cause.

However, as you can see in Figure 2, which shows the temperature
during the last 10 thousand years, the long-term behaviour of
temperature is nothing like a roulette; and if you try to zoom out to
100 thousand years (Figure 3) or to 800 thousand years (Figure 4),
you'll see that not only does it not get any better, but what you see
after zooming out is nothing like what the previous chart suggested.
It is likely that if we had data further into the past, and we could
zoom out more, we would again see a picture very different from what
we expect by looking at Figure 4. What looks like "signal" in Figure 2
is only "noise" in Figure 3, and what looks like "signal" in Figure 4
would again look like "noise" if we had enough data to further zoom
out.

Roulette is unpredictable in the short term, but very predictable in
the long term: you can look at its outcomes as random noise on a
well-known signal. Roulette is very uncertain when you zoom in, but
very certain when you zoom out. Climate is equally uncertain at all
zoom levels.  In fact, mathematical analysis of the climate indicates
that its behaviour is such that the uncertainty is the maximum
possible at all zoom levels. This maximisation of uncertainty at all
scales is called the **Hurst-Kolmogorov behaviour** of climatic
processes [#hk]_.

Nature loves uncertainty, and it fools us in two ways: on the one hand
we wouldn't be able to predict the future of climate, even if we fully knew the
natural laws that govern it, because of chaos; and on the other
hand, we can't be very certain of the statistically expected behaviour
of climate which is based on our observations of the past, because of
the Hurst-Kolmogorov behaviour.

Changes in climate and the weather sometimes have a single dominant
cause, and sometimes they are chaotic. The seasons, for example, are
caused by the fact that the Sun's rays fall at a different angle in
summer than in winter. A storm or a heat wave do not usually have a
single dominant cause, but are created randomly out of chaotic
processes. Why does the climate change? Again, there can be
identifiable dominant causes, or it can be a chaotic change. The
man-made climate change hypothesis says that greenhouse gas emissions
from human activities are the dominant cause; but we've shown that
this hypothesis is unsupported. Whether there is any other dominant
cause or whether these are routine chaotic changes is not resolved. We
feel that it is the latter. We don't know what causes
climate change, and the reason we don't know is that
the uncertainty is structured in the climate, as it is structured
in life itself. Humans do affect climate change, as they have
always been doing, as butterflies also do, their actions contributing
together with infinite other interacting actions to an infinitely
complex and entirely unpredictable system, which depends on everything
and yet on nothing, which is at the same time deterministic and
random.
