The extreme weather
===================

.. epigraph::

   *"Just as dawn began to glow, there arose from the horizon a black
   cloud.... All day long the South Wind blew..., blowing fast,
   submerging the mountain in water, overwhelming the people like an
   attack. No-one could see his fellow, they could not recognize each
   other in the torrent.... Six days and seven nights came the wind
   and flood, the storm flattening the land. When the seventh day
   arrived, the storm was pounding, the flood was a war, struggling
   with itself like a woman writhing in labour. The sea calmed, fell
   still, the whirlwind and flood stopped up. I looked around all day
   long; quiet had set in, and all the human beings had turned to
   clay. The terrain was as flat as a roof. I opened a vent and fresh
   air, daylight, fell upon the side of my nose. I fell to my knees
   and sat weeping, tears streaming down the side of my nose."*

   ―Gilgamesh XI:96–137 [#gilgamesh]_

.. epigraph::

   *"[Hail] fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the
   worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.
   Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fields―both men and
   animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped
   every tree."*

   ―Exodus 9:24 (NIV)

Extreme weather phenomena, however you define them, have been
happening throughout mankind's memory. During the last decade, we have
been told by the media that such events are increasing in frequency or
that they are becoming more intense, and after each catastrophic storm
the word goes that the storm was because of man-made global warming.
It has been implied, for example, that Hurricane Katrina has been the
result of man-made climate change [#pielke-jr]_.  There are two
claims involved here: (a) that extreme weather events are increasing
or intensifying; and (b) that this is the result of man-made global
warming. Let's examine these claims.

We live in Athens, Greece, and the most extreme events we remember
witnessing are a 10-day-long heat wave of 45°C (113°F) in the summer
of 1987; an extremely cold winter in 1986–1987; and intense rainfall
and flooding, which resulted in several deaths, in November 1977.
More recent incidents, as far as we can remember, have been less
marked, and therefore, as everyday casual observers rather than as
scientists, we don't see any evidence that extreme weather events in
Athens have increased. Our subjective experience of Athens may of
course be different than your subjective experience of New Orleans or
of wherever you happen to be living; but if you infer that extreme
weather events are increasing because you witnessed Katrina, we could
also infer that extreme weather events are decreasing because we live
in Athens. What each of us has personally witnessed could well be
random.

But then what about the huge number of extreme weather events that you
have not witnessed and have been brought to your home by the media?
Well, you'll never hear in the news that the weather in Greece is
perfectly normal, because this is not news. You might be interested in
learning that a famine has struck some place in the world, but you'd
be quited bored to be told the list of countries whose diet remains
unaffected. It is reasonable, therefore, for the media to transmit
pictures of extreme weather from around the world, from places which
may not make weather news again for a century. As much as it is
debatable whether the extreme events have changed in the last few
decades, it is beyond doubt that the penetration of the media into the
remotest locations of the planet has increased dramatically.

Our subjective impressions of such events, whether we witnessed them
or learned them from the media, are therefore of no help. We need to
be more scientific: we need to define what we mean by extreme weather
phenomena and count *all* such phenomena of a given large enough
period. Figure 1 shows, for example, the number of major Atlantic
hurricanes per 5 year period from 1946 to 2005; and although this has
been increasing from 1990 to 2005 (and appears to be falling since,
which is not visible in Figure 1), it doesn't look like anything
really unprecedented. Note, also, that this is only the Atlantic:
elsewhere things could have been different, and, indeed, the frequency
of occurrence of cyclones and typhoons in China seems to be decreasing
[#ren]_. When researching such frequency globally, nothing is found
that suggests any significant connection with global warming
[#webster]_.  Other research indicates that, while the number of
hurricanes may be nothing special, there is an unprecedented increase
in their intensity [#emanuel]_; however, that research is debated
([#emanuel-debate1]_, [#emanuel-debate2]_).

As in the case with the melting ice, our aim here is only to show that
there is nothing nearly as alarming as advertised about extreme
weather events. It is media penetration that causes us the impression
of dramatic increase in such events. In reality, there is some change,
but it is not surprising and not unprecedented; and since it is not
unprecedented, it does not constitute any evidence of man-made global
warming. What causes it? We'll come back to this question in the
epilogue.
