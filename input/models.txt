The melting ice, the extreme weather events, and the rising
temperature of the Earth the last few decades, are pointed to,
sometimes by media and environmentalists, and sometimes by scientists,
as the devastating *result* of anthropogenic (man-made) global warming
(AGW), but they are usually not used in scientific circles as
*evidence* of AGW. Scientists who support the AGW theory will usually
admit that, while the climate is changing, this is no news; this has
happened before. But this time, they claim, it's different, and the
reason they know it's different is that this is what the models say.
All humanity's fears about the future of the climate are because of
what the models say.  Let's take a look at these models.

.. admonition:: What is a model?

   Suppose you throw a stone with a certain speed and a certain angle.
   How far will the stone reach? One formula that gives you the
   approximate result in meters is *d*\ =\ *v*\ ²sin\ *a*\ cos\
   *a*/4.9 where *v* is the speed in meters per second and *a* is the
   angle. We call the formula a **model**. The reason we call it a
   model is that it is a representation of reality: the reality is the
   space travelled by the stone, and the formula is an approximation
   that attempts to represent that reality, in the same way that a
   model aircraft is a representation of a real aircraft.  Similarly,
   a map models the landscape, i.e. represents it. In the case of
   mathematical models, such as the above equation, models accept
   input and produce output; in our stone throwing model, *v* and *a*
   is the input and *d* is the output. Making the required
   calculations is frequently called *running the model*, because when
   a model is complicated a computer is needed to perform the
   calculations.

   You must always bear in mind that a model is a model and reality is
   reality. Good models approximate reality well, but they are still
   models; they are not reality.

Climate models, also known as General Circulation Models or GCMs, are
very complicated models that accept a number of inputs such as carbon
dioxide, sun radiation, and many more (the input variables of climate
models are often called forcings). The models are run in huge
supercomputers, and they produce the climate (temperature and rainfall
around the earth) as a function of the input. The argument goes that
when the models are run without the input that is allegedly caused by
humans (i.e. when they are run with the "normal" or "pre-industrial"
concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere), then there is no
global warming; but when they are run with the alleged "anthropogenic
forcings", i.e. with increased carbon dioxide concentrations, then
there is global warming at the end of the 20th century, which
continues throughout the 21st. This, goes on the argument, proves that
the recent warming of the Earth, unlike previous climate changes, is
caused by human activity; and the models, goes on the argument, can
tell us how the climate will be several decades from now.

In other words, if you throw a stone and I tell you how far it will
go, and you ask me why I say so, I can tell you that I calculated it
with the above equation; that is, that the stone-throwing model says
so. This can be a convincing answer only if we have reasons to believe
that the model works well. 

The Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) explains why they
trust their models in pages 600–601 of "The Physical Science Basis"
[#ipcc-models]_, which is part of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.
They mention three reasons: (1) that the models are based on
established physical laws; (2) that the models can reproduce features
of the current climate; (3) that the models can reproduce features of
past climate. We need to examine them one by one.

**(1) The models are based on established physical laws.** If we know
the speed and direction of a die, its dimensions, and the hardness of
the materials of which the die and the surface on which it falls are
constructed, can we predict the outcome? The physical laws of movement
are very well known and understood in that case, but any model would
fail miserably. The reason is that the problem is extremely
complicated.  If a model that attempts to simulate the throwing of a
die fails to represent reality, when the physical laws are fully known
and really well understood, the fact that climate models are based on
physical laws constitutes absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the
models can work well. Climate is incredibly more complex than the
throwing of a die. What's more, by the IPCC's own words, in climate
there are "limitations in scientific understanding" ([#ipcc-models]_,
p. 601).

**(2) The models can reproduce features of current climate.** It's not
difficult to make a dice-throwing model that can reproduce features of
die throwing. A model could be made that reproduces the fact that a
die accelerates downwards; that when it hits the surface it rebounds;
that it maintains its angular momentum; that it loses energy through
friction; and so on. If a model can reproduce these features, this
does not create any confidence whatsoever that it is able to correctly
reproduce the final outcome of a real throw.  Similarly, the fact that
models can reproduce winters and summers, or dry areas and humid
areas, has nothing to do with their ability to tell us how the climate
will be in the future.

**(3) The models can reproduce features of past climate.** This
argument is summarized in Figure 1. Climate models, it is claimed,
are successful in reproducing the climate of the 20th century well,
and therefore it is expected that they will be able to also reproduce
the 21st century. In the Figure, the black line represents reality;
and the yellow lines are 58 different outputs from several different
climate models. The red line is the average of these outputs. Your
first impression would be "wow, the models are good!" But let's take a
more careful look at the Figure.

.. figure:: images/ipcc-model-reproduction-of-20th-century.png

   Figure 1: IPCC's presentation of model reliability
   ([#ipcc-models]_, p. 600).

The vertical axis in Figure 1 represents the departure from the mean
temperature. If, for example, the temperature of the planet is 15°C on
the average, and in 1962 the temperature of the planet was 15.3°C,
then the black line will be at +0.3 in 1962. The problem is that the
comparison is between the real departure and the departure of each
model. If a model says that the temperature is 10°C, and in reality
the temperature is 15°C, this is not visible in Figure 1. This means
that the 60 lines of Figure 1 are artificially made in order to
approximately fall on each other; if plotted without subtracting the
mean, they would be 60 distinct lines, often very far from each other;
if the chart were still only 2°C high, as it is now, many lines would
be entirely outside the chart.

You may argue that if a model could get the departure from the mean,
this would be a remarkable achievement, even if it could not get the
actual value. Indeed. But it's different if you are shown Figure 1 and
you think "wow, the models are good!", and it's different if you were
shown a Figure of 60 entire distinct lines, far from each other, in
which case you'd think "hmm, the models are crap; however, they do
seem to get the slope right."

Do they get the slope right? From what we can see, reality indicates
relatively constant temperature from 1930 to 1970; in contrast, the
models indicate a continuous temperature rise from 1930 to 1970, with
an abrupt drop in 1962, when the Agung volcano errupted. We don't see,
in that Figure, that the erruption has particularly influenced
reality. If you look carefully into Figure 1, you'll notice other
problems as well.

A third problem is that it is completely unscientific to draw the red
line that shows the average of the models. There are absolutely no
scientific grounds to believe that the average of the models is
something special, or that it is better from the models. If the models
get it wrong, there is absolutely no reason why the average of many
models would get it less wrong. In fact, the mere existence of that
red line makes us wonder: how were the 58 model outputs chosen? Why
were those 58 outputs chosen, and not some other 58 outputs? Could
that be cherry-picking?

Finally, even if the models match reality to some extent, how do we
know that they were not made to fit reality? Normally scientists are
extremely careful to adjust their models to match a specific set of
data, and then they check how well their models match an entirely
different set of data. In this case, for example, one could adjust the
models so that they'd match the period 1900―1950, without looking at
1950―2000, and then checking how well the models can match reality for
the latter period. This is not as easy as it seems in the case of
climate models, and it may be impossible because of the huge
complexity of the problem and the fact that there is data for only
about one century; but we've never been given evidence that the match,
to the doubtful extent that it exists, is anything better than
data fitting.

When someone claims that the models are good, the burden is on them to
prove it. If I claim that you are an elephant, the burden is on me to
provide the evidence; you do not need to prove that you are not an
elephant. Instead of clear evidence, we are provided with confusing
arguments and strange linguistic formations: rather than being told
that "there is evidence that the models can predict future climate",
we are being told that "there is considerable confidence that [the
models] provide credible quantitative estimates of future climate,
particularly at continental scales and above." What is "considerable
confidence" and how far is it from certainty? Who is it that is
considerably confident? What is "credible"? Does it merely mean
plausible? What does "particularly at continental scales and above"
mean? Does it mean "only at continental scales and above", as the
quotation by Gavin Schmidt implies? Or does it mean "which is good at
regional scales and even better at larger ones", as is implied by
the IPCC's 94 pages that are crammed with regional details?

A number of studies explain why the models are not credible (e.g.
[#frank]_, [#credibility-revisited]_). But we have chosen, in this
chapter, to only look at what IPCC says. The IPCC should have provided
evidence that models do a decent job, and then we'd be able to start
discussing on the merit of that evidence. But the IPCC, as you can
see, has not provided any evidence. Rather than clear answers to clear
questions, they have provided confusion and lawyerish language.
