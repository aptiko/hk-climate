We intend to leave this text in its originally published form, even if
errors are discovered or if we change our opinion on something, and
only add new footnotes (clearly marked as new), and references to
such new footnotes in the text. This applies only for the home page and
pages "The melting ice" through "Epilogue" (not to the About page or any
newer pages).

uncertain. The photograph of Hurst is from the book *Statisticians of
the Centuries*, edited by C. C. Heyde and E. Seneta, Springer-Verlag,
2001 (p. 335); according to Prof. Seneta (personal communication on 5
and 6 August 2009), its origin is uncertain (Prof. Heyde, who handled
it, has died). The chart from p. 600 of IPCC's AR4, The Physical
Science Basis, is © 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Translations
============

We encourage translating this web site into your own language. 
The licensing already permits you to do so legally and publish the
translation wherever you want; if, however, you want your translation
to appear in http://hk-climate.org/, along with the other languages,
what you must do is download the `source files`_, translate them, and
email us the translated versions. We will then contact you for further
details.

The translated versions of the files must be encoded in UTF-8. If you
use Windows, you will probably find a good editor, such as
`Notepad++`_, helpful.
