The big oil
===========

**[Needs expansion.]**

"Koutsoyiannis is claiming that there is no evidence whatsoever for
anthropogenic climate change. Therefore, either he is in the pay of
big oil, or he is a miserable failure who tries to become famous by
means of stupid demagogy." This amusing argument is often heard
against those scientists who do not believe in the climate hype.

Of course, the argument is totally irrelevant.  If you tell us that
the evidence we presented is wrong, or that we interpreted it
incorrectly, then we might need to further argue with you. But if you
tell us that we are in the pay of big oil, this wouldn't change the
facts that we have presented.  So if you want to believe that we are
being paid by big oil, or that vanity is the reason for this web site,
that's fine with us. Of course, as much as we could be in the pay of
big oil, so Al Gore could be in the pay of big nuke.  So it might be
best to forget who we are, and look at the essence of our arguments
instead.
