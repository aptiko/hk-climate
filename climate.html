<p>In this text, we maintain that there is no reason whatsoever to worry
about anthropogenic (human-induced) climate change, because there is
no evidence whatsoever that such a thing is happening. We explain that
it is all misinformation, and we invite you to check the evidence and
reasoning that we provide to you.</p>
<p>Why do people think that there is anthropogenic climate change? The
alleged evidence which we've seen so far includes the following
arguments:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The ice near the poles has been melting</li>
<li>Extreme weather phenomena have been increasing in frequency</li>
<li>The average temperature of the earth has been increasing</li>
<li>Sea level has been increasing</li>
<li>The computer models predict a further temperature rise in the future</li>
<li>You remember that the weather was different in your childhood</li>
<li>Scientists agree that there is anthropogenic climate change.</li>
<li>In the absence of conclusive evidence, action should be taken
pre-emptively.</li>
<li>We are in the pay of big oil.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following pages, we examine these arguments one by one. We show
that some are entirely false; and that some may be correct but they do
not constitute any evidence of anthropogenic climate change.</p>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="the-melting-ice" name="the-melting-ice">The melting ice</a></h1>
<p>You may have seen, in the media and the web, a chart similar to the
following:</p>
<p>[September Arctic ice extent, up to 2007, vertical axis starts at 4.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: How do we know the ice extent in the sea? We know it because
the sea at the poles is being photographed by satellites on a
daily basis, since 1979. Extracting the ice extent as a number of
square kilometres from the photographs requires image processing,
and different scientists arrive at different results. This is one
reason why our chart might not be exactly the same as those you've
seen elsewhere. Another reason is that some people might include
only the Arctic ocean into their calculations, whereas others
include some bays around Greenland or so. The big picture,
however, remains the same; the ice is being photographed, and
there is little room for interpreting the photographs. This means
that the chart above is close to being a fact, rather than being
theory.</p>
<p>Ice extent before 1979, however, is mostly theory, because it
mostly comes from historical records given by ships, and it
requires lots of assumptions to arrive at generalized results from
records that are sparse both in time and location. Although this
point does not affect our discussion about the melting ice, we
make it because, later on, the distinction between fact and theory
will be of tremendous importance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chart is scary, but we need to make a few corrections. First of
all, the chart starts at 4 million square kilometers, rather than at
zero. There is really no reason why we should put 4 at the bottom.  If
the chart, rather than ice extent, represented your balance, in
thousands of euros, you'd never plot it this way. So, for a start,
let's start the chart at zero:</p>
<p>[September Arctic ice extent, up to 2007, vertical axis starts at 0.]</p>
<p>We don't always put zero at the bottom of a chart, but there must be a
reason for not putting it. In temperature, for example, the position
of zero is conventional; but in ice extent, zero has a physical
meaning. Another reason for which sometimes we &quot;zoom in&quot; a chart is
for seeing details.  But in ice extent, there is no detail in the
zoomed-in version that is not visible in the zero-based version.
Whether the ice extent is 5.5 or 5.6 million square kilometres is a
matter of the image processing algorithms used and of other possible
assumptions and inaccuracies.  Therefore, the details visible in the
zero-based version of the chart already far exceed the accuracy of the
information it presents.</p>
<p>Let's now move to the second correction of the chart, which is to
update it. The chart we've presented includes years from 1979 to 2007.
Let's add 2008 to the picture:</p>
<p>[September Arctic ice extent, up to 2008.]</p>
<p>All above charts show the ice extent in September (we explain this
below). Results are known instantly, and they are published on web
sites. On 1 October we know what the ice extent was in 30 September.
As we write these lines, 29 March 2009, we know what the ice extent
was in 28 March 2009. However, six months after September 2008, we
have yet to see a publication that includes 2008 in the picture: all
publications, especially in popular media, somehow use data only up to
2007.</p>
<p>Until now we only made two minor fixes in the chart: (a) we made it
zero-based; and (b) we updated it with recent data. The chart from
scary became alarming, and then simply worrying. Let's see if it is
really worrying: let's see what the &quot;September&quot; we've been writing on
the charts really means.</p>
<p>The ice does not stay the same. Ice builds up during winter, and it
melts again during summer. In September most Arctic ice has melted,
and it starts to build up again; in March, there is the largest amount
of ice, and then it starts melting again. The difference between March
and September is huge: in September there are 5-8 million square
kilometres of ice, whereas in March there are about 15. This means
that more than half of the ice, up to 10 million square kilometres, is
melting every summer, and then rebuilding each winter.  This, of
course, is absolutely normal, in the same way that some lakes freeze
and thaw each year. Whenever you are shown pictures of melting ice,
you are probably not told that this is the routine melting of ice each
summer, and not anything special.</p>
<p>The chart we've been showing so far shows what is the minimum ice
extent each year; that is, what is the ice extent in September. Most
media publications do not explain this: they merely label the data as
&quot;ice extent&quot;. Some scientific publications for wide consumption do
specify that this is the &quot;minimum annual ice extent&quot;, but the reader
is rarely, if ever, told what this means.</p>
<p>The problem is that there is nothing in the September ice extent that
makes it representative of the planet's temperature any more than is
the March ice extent; or the annual average extent.  What's more, the
Earth has two poles, and there is nothing in the North Pole that makes
it more representative than the South Pole. So here's six charts
together; the top left we've already seen, and the other five are new:</p>
<p>If we assume that there is something in ice extent that is
representative of the planet's temperature, wouldn't that be the total
ice extent, north and south added? Here it is:</p>
<p>[ Total ice extent ]</p>
<p>Some, at this point, might argue that the North Pole might be more
representative than the South, for various reasons, that have to do
with land distribution, or with ocean currents, or whatever, and maybe
they could also similarly argue that, for some reason, September is
more representative than March. Regardless the merit or not of such
claims, here we leave the realm of fact; and rather than entering the
realm of theory, we plunge into deep speculation.</p>
<p>Another argument goes that the ice has not only shrunk in extent, but
it has thinned, from an average of 3 metres to an average of 2 metres
during the last 50 years. But whereas the ice extent is fact, because
it is directly derived from satellite images, the so-called &quot;average&quot;
ice thickness is theory. We have some measurements of ice thickness
because occasionally submarines break the ice and emerge to the
surface of the broken ice, and the captain records the thickness of
the ice in the log. But if you have one measurement by a submarine in
November 1960, and you have another measurement by another submarine,
at a point 1000 km away, in September 1961, and so on, it takes a
large number of questionable assumptions to correlate these sparse
measurements.  Attempts are also being made to derive the ice
thickness from satellite images, but this is also theory. When
processing images in order to determine the ice extent, you know that
something close to white is ice, and something close to blue is water;
but it's not that simple to determine ice thickness, and it is
debatable whether this is at all possible by processing a satellite
image.</p>
<p>Our simple analysis shows that there does exist a generally constant,
but very slow, shrinking of ice during the last 30 years.  Nothing
less, and nothing more. It's a generally constant, very slow,
shrinking of ice. It is so slow that we don't see anything alarming
about it. We think that it does deserve our cool attention, and we
give that attention in a later chapter.</p>

<h1><a id="the-extreme-weather-phenomena" name="the-extreme-weather-phenomena">The extreme weather phenomena</a></h1>
<p>Extreme weather phenomena, however you define them, have been
happening throughout mankind's memory. A large flood happened no later
than 4 thousand years ago according to Gilgamesh. Homer writes about
unfavourable wind persisting for an unusually long time, which delayed
the sailing of the Greek fleet towards Troy more than 3 thousand years
ago. The Book of Exodus talks about 7 consecutive years of drought in
Egypt, which, depending on what you believe, can be a fact or a
legend; but legends usually have a basis in fact. Herodotus talks of a
storm that destroyed a part of the Persian fleet 2500 years ago. And
so on. Has the frequency of extreme weather phenomena increased?</p>
<p>In order to answer this question, we need to define what we mean by
extreme weather phenomena. If last year there was a deadly hurricane
in the U.S., and this year there has been a huge flood in Poland, and
next year there is a huge flood in Spain, and the year after that
there is a typhoon in China, you can't just say anything at all about
the frequency of such phenomena, until you take <em>all</em> similar
phenomena of a large enough period in the past and count them. If you
define hurricanes and typhoons as extreme phenomena, you need to look
at <em>all</em> hurricanes and typhoons of, say, the last 100 years, and not
just the ones you remember, and see if their frequency is increasing.
Here are some charts:</p>
<p>[Four charts: u.s. hurricanes, china typhoons, spanish and polish
floods.]</p>
<p>These charts are not proof that extreme weather phenomena are not
increasing; we might have been cherry-picking. The point that we are
trying to make is that a deadly hurricane, or any kind of extreme
weather event, does not constitute evidence of climate change; and
that it is very difficult to define, or measure, the &quot;frequency of
extreme weather phenomena&quot;.</p>
<p>There is, however, an undeniable increase in the frequency with which
media trasmit pictures of extreme phenomena from around the world. We
observe floods and destructions that we would otherwise not know, and
this creates a false perception that the extreme phenomena have become
more frequent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a change in the way we perceive nature. Being
used to always having water in the tap of our house and air
conditioners that adjust the temperature throughout the year, we have
forgotten that Nature does not feature any such kind of monotonous
constantness. We have become passive observers and we magnify every
small unsettling natural phenomenon.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="the-average-temperature-of-the-earth" name="the-average-temperature-of-the-earth">The average temperature of the Earth</a></h1>
<p>The average temperature of the Earth, it is claimed, has increased by
0.7°C during the last 100 years, and this, it is also claimed, is the
result of anthropogenic global warming. These are two claims. Let's
examine them one by one.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that the Earth has no such hole in which
you can stick a thermometer and take a reading.  Determining the
so-called average temperature of the Earth is a very complicated
business. You need to use measurements of temperatures wherever those
exist, and make assumptions about how to average them over areas. In
addition, 0.7°C is a very low variation, barely over the accuracy
range of most thermometers. If you have measurements from 1850 to 1950
in a location, it is not the same thermometer that was used throughout
that period; and even the same thermometer might produce slightly
different measurements during its life.  This means that you have to
go into very complex studies, comparing measurements with those in
nearby locations (which also, of course, suffer from the same
problems), and doing appropriate calibrations. You can rarely reliably
reach an accuracy of 0.7°C.</p>
<p>Even if you solve these problems, and you can safely arrive at the
conclusion that your measurements do indicate a temperature increase,
it is by no means easy to generalize to the Earth average. Maybe the
earth has heated up and the sea has cooled down; maybe Europe and
North America (where there are many measuring stations) have heated up
but Africa has cooled down. Maybe the Northern Hemisphere has heated
up and the Southern has cooled down. In addition, thermometers are
usually located near urban areas, and urbanisation does cause a local
temperature increase, which, however, is not necessarily an indication
of a global temperature increase. Since 1978, another means of
measuring global temperature is with satellites, but this is also
indirect and involves assumptions and calculations. Therefore, the
alleged average global temperature increase, rather than fact, is
theory.</p>
<p>All we can tell you is that the alleged increase is theory. We cannot
tell you whether it is good theory or bad theory, because we have not
examined it. Maybe this claimed 0.7±0.2°C is an excellent result of
outstanding work that tackles the difficulties with ingenuity. Maybe
it is completely crap. It is tempting to observe that the polar ice is
slowly melting, and that this is in agreement with the theory that
average temperature has increased by 0.7°C; however, not only do we
not have data for the ice before the 1970s, but the Earth's oceans and
atmosphere are such an incredibly complicated system that you cannot
really expect that the ice extent should correlate with average
temperature, especially when we are talking about such small
differences.</p>
<p>All we can say is that 0.7°C in 100 years is a quite reasonable
change, not especially worthy of much notice. The Earth's temperature
has never stayed the same. It is believed that ten thousand years ago,
when the last ice age ended, the temperature of the Earth was 8
degrees lower than it is today, and that 5 thousand years ago it was 2
degrees higher. A change of 0.7°C in a century is not unusual and it
does not indicate a permanent trend any more than does a difference in
temperature between yesterday and today. This is an important issue
which we will visit again later.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="the-climate-models" name="the-climate-models">The climate models</a></h1>
<p>Several scientists claim that they know that the Earth is warming,
that the reason is human activity, and that they can tell us exactly
how much it will have warmed in 100 years. The most important such
group of scientists is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC). In this chapter we explain on what grounds they base
their claims. This is a long and difficult chapter, but it is very
important because we explain essential things about how the climate
works.</p>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="the-greenhouse-effect-and-the-hypothesized-global-warming" name="the-greenhouse-effect-and-the-hypothesized-global-warming">The greenhouse effect and the hypothesized global warming</a></h2>
<p>If a body is warm, then it radiates heat. You can understand this if
you approach your hand to a radiator; you can feel the heat being
radiated. The warmer the body, the higher the amount of heat being
radiated. In addition, if a body absorbs more heat than it emits, its
temperature increases; if it emits more heat than it absorbs, its
temperature decreases; and if it emits exactly as much heat as it
absorbs, then its temperature is constant.</p>
<p>(This is only for bodies that do not produce any heat by themselves.
For example, the sun emits heat, but it does not cool down, because it
produces it with nuclear fusion. Your body emits heat, but it does not
cool down, because it produces it by burning the nutrients it gets
when you eat. But the Earth does not produce any heat on its own.)</p>
<p>The Earth absorbs heat that is radiated from the Sun, and at the same
time it emits heat into space. The Earth absorbs about as much heat as
it emits, otherwise it would eventually either burn or freeze. If it
were not for the greenhouse effect, the earth's average temperature
would be about -5°C, and life as we know it would not exist, because
everything would be frozen.</p>
<p>However, the atmosphere has an interesting property: although it
allows heat from the sun to enter the atmosphere and reach the surface
of the earth, it blocks a large part of that heat from leaving the
earth and escaping to space. As a result, more heat is absorbed
from the earth than emitted. Therefore, the Earth's temperature
increases. Because the Earth's temperature increases, it emits more
heat into space. When the Earth's temperature is so high that the heat
emitted is the same as the heat absorbed, then the temperature
stabilizes again. In other words, absorbed and emitted heat reach
equilibrium at higher temperature because of the heat trapping
property of the atmosphere. We call this phenomenon the greenhouse
effect, because it resembles a greenhouse.</p>
<p>It is believed that the greenhouse effect is partially caused by
certain gases that we call the greenhouse gases. The most important
such gases are believed to be water vapour and carbon dioxide. Carbon
dioxide is produced by burning. Your cells burn certain substances,
and therefore they produce carbon dioxide, which your blood carries to
your lungs, and from there it is released to the atmosphere when you
exhale. Carbon dioxide is also produced by cars, aeroplanes, ships,
heating systems, fossil fuel power plants, and generally anything that
burns fossil fuel (that is, coal, natural gas, and oil) or anything
else.</p>
<p>The usual claim is that the earth is warming because of the increase
in carbon dioxide produced by human activities, namely the burning of
fossil fuel. The reasoning is that since carbon dioxide is a
greenhouse gas, more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will result in a
stronger greenhouse effect, which will raise the Earth's temperature.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="the-calculation-of-future-earth-temperature" name="the-calculation-of-future-earth-temperature">The calculation of future Earth temperature</a></h2>
<p>The scientists who make claims about the future Earth temperature use
sets of mathematical formulas which allegedly produce the average
temperature and rainfall as a function of incoming heat from the sun,
carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere, and many more
variables.  These sets of formulas are called <strong>climate models</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to explain it better, let's use an example. Suppose you throw
a stone with a certain speed and a certain angle. How far will the
stone reach? One formula that gives you the approximate result in
meters is</p>
<blockquote>
d = v^2*sina*cosa/4.9</blockquote>
<p>where v is the speed in m/s and a is the angle. This formula is a
simple model with two variables (v and a) and no parameters. We call
it a model because it is a representation of reality; the reality is
the stone you are throwing; and the formula is an approximation that
attempts to represent that reality, in the same way that a model
aircraft is a representation of a real aircraft.</p>
<p>Although the model we use above works, we might want to use the
following, instead, which is more accurate:</p>
<blockquote>
(2*v^2*sina*cosa)</blockquote>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: WARNING/2 (<tt class="docutils">climate.txt</tt>, line 372)</p>
Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.</div>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>d = ----------------------------------------------------------------</dt>
<dd>9.780327*(1+0.0053024*(sinφ)^2-0.0000058(sin2φ)^2)-0.000003.086h</dd>
</dl>
<p>which also incorporates the latitude φ and the altitude h. It is
therefore a model with two variables and two parameters. Although this
gives more accurate results, the downside is obvious: it is more
complicated and harder to calculate. Although the above two models may
work well for throwing stones, if you want to throw a bomb over long
distances you may need much more complicated models, with more
parameters: you'd have to take into account the air pressure, wind
speed, and possibly the air temperature.</p>
<p>Climate models are much more complicated than that, and contain a
large number of parameters. A climate model consists of thousands of
formulas, and huge supercomputers are required in order to perform the
calculations.</p>
<p>The problem is that there is not the slightest evidence that climate
models produce correct results. The scientists who make these models
(and who are funded with huge amounts of money, because supercomputers
cost a lot, and so do the specialized computer engineers who are able
to program them properly) have never told us why they think that their
results are OK. They just publish the model output, which usually
concerns a conveniently far future, and claim that they have made a
prediction. (In fact, climate modelers would correct us at this point
by claiming that they don't make predictions, but that they make
projections. The thing is that these calculations are presented to us
with a claim of how the climate is going to be in the future, so we'll
be calling them predictions. You can call them projections if you
prefer. We wouldn't even mind if you called them George.)</p>
<p>Then time passes, and the conveniently far future starts to come
inconveniently near. The results of the models are in danger of being
falsified. Meanwhile, with the passage of time, computing power
increases, and the climate modelers now claim that they can make more
complicated models, which allegedly address the shortcomings of the
old models, and they ask for more money in order to make them. The
story then goes over again.  However, there is no such thing as
&quot;shortcomings of the old models&quot;.  It is meaningful to talk about a
shortcoming of a model only if the model is of value. It is meaningful
if I tell you that the first stone-throwing model above has the
shortcoming that it does not take the altitude into account, because
it does already produce decent results. But if we use &quot;d = v * sinφ&quot;
as a stone-throwing model, it is meaningless to talk about
shortcomings, because this model is totally irrelevant with reality.</p>
<p>Let's repeat that: there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that
climate model outputs have any value. The modelers have never
validated them, i.e. tested them with known data. If you find that
hard to believe, please send them a letter and ask them. If you get a
reply, let us know.</p>
<p>In fact, although the burden of proof is with the one who makes the
claim, and therefore it is the modelers' responsibility to convince us
that the models are useful, it is the skeptics who undertook the task
of validating the models. A growing number of publications tests the
model outputs against real data, and the findings are that the models
are irrelevant with reality. The climate modelers are not convinced,
of course: they ask for more money, in order to refine the models, in
order to address the &quot;shortcomings&quot;, and so on.</p>

<p>Maybe you remember that the weather was different in your childhood.
Maybe your great-grandfather tells you stories that show that it used
to snow, or that the atmosphere was clear, or whatever. While your
memory is very selective and far from objective, it is also true that
the weather <em>was</em> different in your childhood. We don't claim that the
weather, or the climate, stays the same. It changes all the time.</p>
<p>We like to use the example of a housefly that is born in Athens,
Greece, in 15 July. Houseflies normally live up to 25 days, and our
example housefly is a particularly long-lived one that dies in 15
August. We select 15 July to 15 August for our example because any
temperature variations in this period are random in Greece (in
contrast to, for example, April, where 1 April is, on the average,
cooler than 30 April).</p>
<p>In our example, some days are hot, about 35-36°C, some are cool, about
29-30°C, and so, during its exceptionally long life, our housefly
experiences a large and interesting range of temperatures. It is 11
August, and the housefly even remembers an event that happened in its
early days, in 17 July, of water falling from the sky, which had
forced it to stay hidden.</p>
<p>Then, on 12 August, a heat wave strikes Athens, raising the
temperature to 39°C. On 13 August it is 41°C, and on the 14th it has
reached 42°C. By human standards, this is quite usual; such a heat
wave happens in Athens almost every year. But our 30-day-old housefly
has never seen anything like that, despite the fact that it is way
older than any of its fellow houseflies. &quot;Never in my life have I seen
such heat!&quot;, it exclaims; and it is misled into thinking that the
climate is changing in an unusual manner, and that the world is coming
to an end.</p>
<p>Do you think that your lifetime is more significant in this respect
than the housefly's 30 days? Look at the following timeline, which
shows climate change in the last 100 thousand years, and think again:</p>

<h1><a id="pre-emptive-action" name="pre-emptive-action">Pre-emptive action</a></h1>
<p>&quot;Even if there is no evidence of anthropogenic global warming,&quot; goes
an often-heard argument, &quot;we shouldn't wait until we see a problem; we
should take action before&quot;.</p>
<p>First of all: we must decide what we are discussing about. Are we
discussing whether there is any evidence for anthropogenic global
warming? Then this argument has no position in the discussion; it is
totally irrelevant. That is the discussion we have been making so far.
There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever of anthropogenic global
warming.  That human activities can generally harm the environment is
a very serious issue, but it is a very different discussion, and it
does not in any way alter the fact that there is absolutely no
evidence whatsoever of anthropogenic global warming.</p>
<p>Any action, pre-emptive or not, has effects.  If you want to make an
omelette, you'll need to break the eggs, regardless of whether the
omelette is pre-emptive. If you want to reduce the amount of emitted
carbon dioxide, you'll need to reduce fossil fuel consumption. Let's
see what this implies.</p>
<p>There are two ways to reduce fossil fuel consumption: one is to
consume less energy; and the other is to use alternative forms of
energy. You can also use a combination of those.</p>
<p>Consuming less energy means really consuming less energy. There are no
magical solutions. If you think that technological developments like
&quot;energy-saving&quot; lamps are the solution, think again. If all lamps of
the planet were replaced by &quot;energy-saving&quot; lamps, we would barely
save one percent of energy, and even this is questionable. One percent
would be barely perceptible in the following graph:</p>
<p>[Global energy consumption]</p>
<p>Consuming less energy means not owning a car. Never entering an
aeroplane. Never getting on a railway that travels faster than 90 km/h
(55 mph). Not replacing your mobile phone with a new one before you
have owned it for 10 years. Not consuming food that needs to travel
more than 200 km (120 miles) to arrive to you. You might think we are
hallucinating, but if what you want is to reverse the trend in the
graph above, this is what you need to do. You can't do it with
energy-saving lamps or hybrid cars. There are no magical solutions.</p>
<p>As much as we believe that life might be better if we lived as
described above, we are also convinced that this is absolutely
impossible the way western society and economy are structured, unless
a large part of the population dies of starvation. Therefore, although
we agree that long term measures to reverse the global energy
consumption trend should be applied (and by long term we mean long
term), the short term pre-emptive measures you are seeking cannot be
found in consuming less energy. The only alternative for pre-emptive
action is therefore alternative energy sources.</p>
<p>Once more, as much as you cannot make an omelette without breaking the
eggs, you cannot produce energy without harming the environment. Wind
turbines may look beautiful to you, but in order to replace one fossil
fuel power plant you need one or two thousand wind turbines. It may be
difficult to understand what one thousand wind turbines means, until
you see a huge number, count them, and find them to be only 50 or 100.
In mountainous areas like Greece, wind turbines can seriously harm the
landscape. What's more, thousands of km of roads need to be opened for
these turbines to be installed and maintained, further harming the
landscape. Finally, wind turbines produce energy when wind blows, and
not necessarily when you want the energy. If there existed an easy way
for storing electric power, your house wouldn't need to be connected
to the power grid: you'd buy charged batteries once in a while and
that would be all; and your car would simply be electric.</p>
<p>Similarly, for producing energy from the sun, in the huge quantities
that we consume, we'd need to cover vast areas with mirrors or solar
cells or whatever, and, again, these would not produce energy during
the night. For producing energy from water, huge reservoirs, that is,
artificial lakes, need to be constructed, which is poses serious
environmental questions; and the extent to which it is possible
depends on whether there are mountains and enough water in the area.</p>
<p>The renewables, as all these forms of energy are collectively called,
certainly need to be explored; but there is no easy way. You can't
just use the &quot;renewables&quot; label and think that you found a neat
solution for all your problems. What's more, it is debatable whether
the technology of the renewables has reached a stage where they can
entirely replace a significant part of fossil fuel power plants.</p>
<p>There is only one form of energy which can replace fossil fuel plants
reliably and without burning anything: nuclear power. But this, if we
ignore the probability of accidents, has the problem of nuclear waste.
You can build the plant today and not worry about what you are going
to do when it closes. But it <em>will</em> close. About 50 years from now.
You cannot demolish a nuclear reactor. You can shut it down, bury it
in concrete, and hope that nothing bad is going to happen for one or
two thousand years. (Incidentally, if you think that nuclear fusion is
the answer, because it is supposedly clean: maybe it is, but it's not
here yet. No nuclear fusion reactor has been produced yet that
produces more energy than it consumes. Until one is produced, nuclear
fusion will only be hope, and there can be no guarantee that it will
be ready when we need it.)</p>
<p>In order to evaluate these risks, you need to think in a cool manner.
You must evaluate the dangers of fossil fuel correctly, the problems
of the renewables correctly, and the dangers of nuclear power
correctly. Taking pre-emptive action against fossil fuel does not make
any sense any more than taking pre-emptive action against the
renewables, since all have known problems.</p>
<p>Finally, there is something strange about requests to take pre-emptive
action. Look around you and check if life is normal, or whether the
environment in which you live is OK. That something is seriously wrong
is obvious. Why do we need to take pre-emptive action for a problem
that is strictly speculative, when there are pressing problems that
need immediate action? The economy is in serious trouble. We are
running out of energy. We are polluting underground water. We consume
15 calories of energy for each calory of food that we place on our
table. We raise chicken in inhumane conditions in dark, stinking
factories, and then we eat their sick meat and their sick eggs.  The
same goes on for all kinds of food. We are gradually extiguishing the
night sky, and the inherent beauty of natural darkness, with our light
pollution. We are expanding our noise-polluting roads out of the
cities, and we live in conditions where living a moment's peace
becomes increasingly difficult. We are running around like crazy, full
of stress and depression. These problems are right in front of our
eyes, and we live in them every day. Why do we need to take
pre-emptive action against a non-problem, when we have all these
pressing problems that need immediate attention? Taking pre-emptive
action against the alleged anthropogenic climate change could further
harm the environment, and at the same time it takes our attention away
from real, undisputed problems.</p>
